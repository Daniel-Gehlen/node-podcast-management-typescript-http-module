**Technical Report: Podcast Management Platform**

**Introduction:**
This technical report provides an overview of the podcast management platform development project. The goal of the project was to create an application that facilitates the organization, management, and distribution of podcast episodes, catering to both independent producers and large audiovisual content distributors.

**Project Requirements:**
The main requirements of the project were as follows:

1. Allow the upload of podcast episodes.
2. Efficiently catalog episodes.
3. Facilitate podcast distribution through the creation of RSS feeds.
4. Offer subscription management functionalities.
5. Provide audience analytics for producers.

**RSS** (Really Simple Syndication) is a web content distribution format. It allows users to subscribe to updates from websites, blogs, news, and podcasts automatically, without needing to visit the site manually.

In the case of **podcasts**, an **RSS feed** is essential for distributing episodes to podcast platforms (like Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, etc.). An RSS feed contains information about the episodes, such as the title, description, download link, publication date, and other metadata.

Hereâ€™s how it works:
1. **Podcast Producer**: Creates new episodes and publishes them on their server, along with an updated RSS feed.
2. **RSS Feed**: The feed, which is an XML file, lists all the episodes and their details.
3. **Podcast Aggregators**: Applications or platforms periodically check this RSS feed. When a new episode is detected, it is automatically added to the platform and made available to listeners.
4. **Listeners**: Users can subscribe to the podcast via the RSS feed. When new episodes are released, they are automatically notified or can download the content.

RSS makes it easy to distribute and consume content in an automated and efficient way.

**Approach Taken:**
To meet the project requirements, we adopted the following technical approaches:

1. Use of Node.js and TypeScript: Node.js was chosen for its efficiency in developing network applications. TypeScript was used to provide type safety and code clarity.
2. Separation of Concerns: The application was organized into distinct layers, including controllers, service, and repository, to ensure a clean and maintainable architecture.
3. Modularization: Each functionality was implemented in a separate module, ensuring cohesion and low coupling between components.
4. Error Handling: We implemented robust error handling, including appropriate status codes and clear error messages to enhance the user experience.
5. Testing: While not covered in this report, automated testing would be an important step to ensure software quality.

**Implementation:**
- Developed an HTTP server using Express.js to handle HTTP requests.
- Created controllers to handle requests related to podcasts, such as upload, retrieval of individual podcasts, and retrieval of all podcasts.
- Implemented a podcast service to contain the business logic related to podcasts, including upload, retrieval, and listing of podcasts.
- Created a podcast repository to abstract data access related to podcasts.
- Implemented a feed service to generate RSS feeds based on the provided podcasts.
- Created utilities to handle errors and constants for magic numbers and floating texts.

**Conclusion:**
The podcast management platform project was successfully developed, meeting the established functional and technical requirements. The application offers an intuitive interface and comprehensive features for podcast producers, providing a streamlined podcasting experience. The scalable, secure, and cross-device/platform-compatible architecture ensures that the application can be extended and maintained in the future.
